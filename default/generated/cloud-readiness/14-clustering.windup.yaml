  message: "To migrate a distributed application that is clustered around several\
    \ servers to Azure, you can follow these recommendations:\n\n * **Configure multiple\
    \ instances **: Deploy your Java application to Azure App Service and configure\
    \ multiple instances within the same App Service Plan to create a cluster-like\
    \ setup. Azure App Service automatically load-balances incoming requests across\
    \ the available instances, ensuring scalability and high availability.\n\n * **Manage\
    \ sessions in a clustered environment**: Consider using an external session store\
    \ such as Azure Cache for Redis. Configure your Java application to connect to\
    \ the Azure Cache for Redis and to replicate sessions across the instances."
