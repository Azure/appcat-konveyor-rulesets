  message: |-
    The application contains an embedded resource adapter descriptor ('ra.xml'), which implements the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for certain Enterprise Information Systems (EIS).

     JCA often uses tightly coupled interactions between the connector and the application. Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud environment because of scalability problems.

     Recommendation: Review the purpose of the resource adapter to determine whether it is required in a cloud environment.
