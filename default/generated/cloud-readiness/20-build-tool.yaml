    Ant build tool detected in the project. It lacks standard conventions and dependency management, making it less suitable for modern cloud-native development and CI/CD practices.
    It is recommended to migrate this project to **Maven** to take advantage of:
    - Convention-over-configuration build structure
    - Robust dependency management via Maven Central
    - Better integration with modern IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud tools

    Eclipse project detected. This project appears to use Eclipse-specific configurations, such as WTP or JEM natures, which can make build and deployment less portable in cloud environments.
    Ii's recommended to migrate the project to a standard build tool like **Maven** for improved portability, reproducibility, and CI/CD automation.
