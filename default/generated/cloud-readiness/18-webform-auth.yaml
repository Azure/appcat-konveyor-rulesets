    Using Web Forms authentication requires that user accounts and passwords be created and managed in a storage such as a database. This mechanism does not offer the flexibility of claims-based authentication and should not be used in Cloud applications. Ideally, user authentication should be replaced by a Cloud-based and OS-agnostic identity & access management solution such as Active Directory.
