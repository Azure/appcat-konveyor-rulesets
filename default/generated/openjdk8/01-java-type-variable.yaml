  message: |-
    In Java 8, the value returned from `javax.lang.model.type.TypeVariable.getUpperBound` for `TypeVariables` with multiple bounds is different from the return value in earlier releases. An instance of the newly introduced `IntersectionType` is now returned, while originally an instance of `DeclaredType` was returned. 
    
    This may cause a change in behavior of existing implementations of `javax.lang.model.util.TypeVisitor`: before, the `visitDeclared` method was invoked for the return value of `TypeVariable.getUpperBound` for type variables with multiple bounds, now `visitIntersection` is invoked. The difference can also observed by calling `getKind()` of the returned value.
