  message: |-
    The mechanism to select a `LocaleServiceProvider` has changed. `LocaleServiceProvider` implementations are now able to determine whether the given Locale can be supported by overriding the `LocaleServiceProvider.isSupportedLocale` method. 
    
    However, overriding this method for strict locale extensions checking may involve some compatibility problems with existing applications if locale service providers are migrating from JDK 7. Refer to the descriptions of the `LocaleServiceProvider` class and its `isSupportedLocale` method for more details.
