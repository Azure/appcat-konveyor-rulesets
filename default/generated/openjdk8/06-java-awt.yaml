  message: |-
    Prior to the Java SE 8 release, a manual check was required to ensure that keystrokes were of type `AWTKeyStroke`. This check has been replaced by a generic check in the `Component.setFocusTraversalKeys()` and `KeyboardFocusManager.setDefaultFocusTraversalKeys()` methods. A `ClassCastException` is now thrown if any `Object` is not of type `AWTKeyStroke`.
