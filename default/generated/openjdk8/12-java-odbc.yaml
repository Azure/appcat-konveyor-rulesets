  message: |-
    Starting with JDK 8, the JDBC-ODBC Bridge is no longer included with the JDK. The JDBC-ODBC Bridge has always been considered transitional and a non-supported product that was only provided with select JDK bundles and not included with the JRE. Instead, use a JDBC driver provided by the vendor of the database or a commercial JDBC Driver instead of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge
