  message: |-
    Developers that use the unsupported `sun.misc.Unsafe` API should be aware that the methods that return base and field offsets have been deprecated in this release. The methods `objectFieldOffset`, `staticFieldOffset`, and `staticFieldBase` methods are an impediment to future changes. A future release will eventually degrade or remove these methods along with the heap accessor methods.

    The `java.lang.invoke.VarHandle` API (added in Java 9) provides a strongly typed reference to a variable that is safe and a replacement to many cases that use field offsets and the heap accessor methods. It is strongly recommended to migrate to the VarHandle API where possible. Multi-Release JARs can be used by libraries and frameworks that continue to support JDK 8 or older.
