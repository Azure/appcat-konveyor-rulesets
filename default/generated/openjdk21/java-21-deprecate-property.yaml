  message: |-
    The system property `java.compiler` has been removed from the list of standard system properties.

    Running with this system property set on the command line will now print a warning to say that the system property is obsolete; it has no other effect. In previous releases, running with `-Djava.compiler` or `-Djava.compiler=NONE` on the command line selected interpreter only execution mode. If needed, the -Xint option can be used to run in interpreter only mode.

  message: |-
    The `java.lang.Compiler` class has been removed. This under-specified API dates from JDK 1.0 and the "Classic VM" used in early JDK releases. Its implementation in the HotSpot VM does nothing but print a warning that it is not supported. The class has been deprecated and marked for removal since Java SE 9.
