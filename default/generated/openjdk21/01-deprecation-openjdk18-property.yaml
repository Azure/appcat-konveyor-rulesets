    url: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/18all-relnotes.html#JDK-8274227
  message: |-
    The system property `impl.prefix` has been removed. This undocumented system property dates from early JDK releases where it was possible to add an implementation of the JDK internal and non-public `java.net.InetAddressImpl` interface to the `java.net` package, and have it be used by the `java.net.InetAddress` API.
    The `InetAddressResolver` SPI provides a standard way to implement a name and address resolver.
