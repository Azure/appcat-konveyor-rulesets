  message: |-
    The JMX Subject Delegation feature is deprecated and marked for removal in a future release. This feature is enabled by the method `javax.management.remote.JMXConnector.getMBeanServerConnection(javax.security.auth.Subject)` which is deprecated for removal.

    If a client application needs to perform operations as, or on behalf of, multiple identities, it will need to make multiple calls to `JMXConnectorFactory.connect()` and to the `getMBeanServerConnection()` method on the returned JMXConnector.
