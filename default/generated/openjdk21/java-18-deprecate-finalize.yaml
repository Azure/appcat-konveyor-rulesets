  message: |-
    The `java.desktop` module has a few implementations of `finalize()` that did nothing.
    These methods were deprecated in Java 9 and terminally deprecated in Java 16. These methods have been removed in this release.

  message: |-
    The finalization mechanism has been deprecated for removal in a future release. The `finalize` methods in standard Java APIs, such as `Object.finalize()` and `Enum.finalize()`, have also been deprecated for removal in a future release, along with methods related to finalization, such as `Runtime.runFinalization()` and `System.runFinalization()`.
    Finalization remains enabled by default, but it can be disabled for testing purposes by using the command-line option `--finalization=disabled` introduced in this release. Maintainers of libraries and applications that rely upon finalization should migrate to other resource management techniques in their code, such as try-with-resources and cleaners.
