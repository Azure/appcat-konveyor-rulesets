    To migrate Java applications using JBoss EAP to Azure Kubernetes Service, you can consider two options:
    1. Lift-and-Shift with JBoss EAP
    Use Red Hat certified JBoss EAP container images as the base for your application, and package your Java application together with JBoss EAP in a container image. Define Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap for networking, scaling, and configuration.

    2. Refactor to Remove JBoss EAP
    Decouple your application from JBoss EAP and migrate to a lighter runtime (e.g., Spring Boot, Quarkus, or Micronaut). This reduces complexity and improves cloud-native compatibility. And then package your Java application in a container image. Define Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap for networking, scaling, and configuration.
