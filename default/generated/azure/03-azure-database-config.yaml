  message: "The application uses a MongoDB connection string. To migrate a Java application
    that uses a MongoDB connection string to Azure, you can follow these recommendations:\n\n
    * Use a managed **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB**: Create a managed Cosmos DB for
    MongoDB database in Azure and choose the appropriate pricing tier based on your
    application's requirements for performance, storage, and availability.\n \n *
    **Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB using Service Connector**: Create service
    connection using **Service Connector** to connect your application to Azure Cosmos
    DB for MongoDB. Service Connector provides a secure and easy way to connect your
    application to Azure services without having to manage secrets or credentials
    in your application code.\n\n * **Passwordless connections for Azure services**:
    Consider using passwordless connections for Azure services. You can provide an
    additional layer of security and convenience for accessing resources in Azure
    by eliminating the need for passwords. This way you can reduce the risk of password-related
    vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords or password theft."
