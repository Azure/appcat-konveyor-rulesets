  message: "Redis Cache connection string, username, or password used in this application.
    To migrate a Java application that uses a Redis Cache connection string to Azure,
    you can follow these recommendations:\n \n * **Provision an Azure Cache for Redis**:
    Checkout Azure Cache for Redis for a fully managed cache on Azure. You can take
    advantage of a managed Redis service that offers scalability, high availability,
    and monitoring capabilities. **Azure Cache for Redis** provides features like
    data persistence, automatic failover, and built-in support for Redis commands,
    allowing you to leverage the benefits of Redis caching in your application running
    on Azure. Configure the cache size and other relevant settings based on your application's
    requirements.\n \n * **Update your Java code**: Replace the embedded Redis cache
    code in your Java application with the Azure Cache for Redis client libraries
    or SDKs. Update the code that establishes a connection to the Redis cache and
    performs cache-related operations.\n \n * **Connect to Azure Cache for Redis**:
    Connect your app to Azure Cache for Redis on azure by **Service Connector**. Instead
    of manually configuring connection string in your applications, you can automatically
    connect Azure Cache for Redis to your applications."
