    Your application is using the Spring Framework version out of support. 
    Upgrading to a supported version ensures better performance, security, and compatibility with modern tools.
      1. Pick a Supported Version: Review the Spring Framework support policy and choose an actively supported version.
      2. Update Your Project: Change the Spring Framework version in your pom.xml or build.gradle.
      3. Fix Compatibility Issues: Update deprecated code, replace removed features, and ensure dependencies are compatible with the new Spring Framework version.
      4. Thoroughly Test: Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to make sure everything still works after the upgrade.
