  message: "The application has configuration for VMware Tanzu Application Service
    (TAS) service bindings.\n To migrate a Java application that uses TAS service
    bindings to Azure, you can follow these recommendations:\n \n * Examine the VCAP_SERVICES
    variable for configuration settings of external services bound to the application\n\n
    * Consider using Service Connector to connect Azure compute services to other
    backing services. \n This service configures the network settings and connection
    information (for example, generating environment variables) between compute services
    and target backing services in management plane."
