    Your application is not using the latest Jakarta EE version. 
    Upgrading to the latest stable version ensures better performance, security, and compatibility with modern tools.
      1. Pick a Supported Version: Review the Jakarta EE release versions and choose an actively supported version.
      2. Update Your Project: Change the Jakarta EE version in your pom.xml or build.gradle.
      3. Fix Compatibility Issues: Update deprecated code, replace removed features, and ensure dependencies are compatible with the new Jakarta EE version.
      4. Thoroughly Test: Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to make sure everything still works after the upgrade.
