    The application contains AWS credential configuration.

     * Migrate credentials to **Azure Key Vault**: Create an Azure Key Vault to securely store your application's credentials and sensitive information. Migrate the AWS credentials to Azure Key Vault, which provides a centralized and highly secure storage solution.

     * **Modify application code**: Update the Java application's code to retrieve the required credentials from Azure Key Vault instead of AWS. Use the appropriate Azure SDK or libraries to integrate with Azure Key Vault and fetch the credentials securely during runtime.

     * Implement **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication**: If the AWS credentials are used for authentication purposes, consider migrating to Azure AD for user authentication and authorization. Implement Azure AD authentication in your Java application to ensure secure access to Azure resources.

     * **Update application code**: Modify the Java application's code to replace AWS SDK calls with the equivalent Azure Storage SDK calls for Azure Blob Storage. Update the code to authenticate and interact with Azure Blob Storage using the Azure SDK for Java.

     * **Map S3 functionality** to Azure Blob Storage: Understand the differences between AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage, and adjust your application logic accordingly. Map S3 concepts (buckets, objects, permissions, etc.) to their Azure Blob Storage equivalents (containers, blobs, shared access signatures, etc.).

     * **Migrate data** from S3 to Azure Blob Storage: Plan and execute the migration of your data from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage. You can use Azure Storage Data Transfer Tool, AzCopy, or other migration tools to copy the data from S3 buckets to Azure Blob Storage containers.

     * Update **access permissions**: Adjust the access permissions and policies in Azure Blob Storage to match your application's requirements. Azure provides various options for controlling access, including shared access signatures (SAS), Azure AD authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC).

     * Validate functionality and **performance**: Thoroughly test the updated application to ensure that it can read from and write to Azure Blob Storage correctly. Validate the performance of data transfer and any other operations to ensure they meet your application's requirements.
