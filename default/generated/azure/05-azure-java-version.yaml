    The application is using an old Java version. It is strongly recommended to plan and execute a migration strategy to upgrade your application to a newer supported Java version.
    Older Java versions may have known security vulnerabilities that can expose your application and infrastructure to potential attacks. Migrating to a supported version ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches and updates.
