  - title: Removal of Thread.destroy() and Thread.stop(Throwable) Methods
    url: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8204243
  message: |-
    The methods `Thread.destroy()` and `Thread.stop(Throwable)` have been removed. They have been deprecated for several Java SE releases. 
    The `Thread.destroy()` method has never been implemented, and the `Thread.stop(Throwable)` method has been non-functional since Java SE 8. 
    No code should rely on the behavior of these two methods; however, any code that uses these methods will cause compilation errors. The mitigation is to remove references to these methods from the source code. Note that the no-arg method `Thread.stop()` is unaffected by this change.
