  message: |-
    Deprecate the `pack200` and `unpack200` tools, and the Pack200 API in `java.util.jar` (JEP 336).

    The `pack200` API and the tools associated with it, `pack200` and `unpack200`, have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

    Those tools are still included in JDK 11, but will no longer be updated to support the latest class file format. Class files with unknown attributes will be passed-through without compression.
