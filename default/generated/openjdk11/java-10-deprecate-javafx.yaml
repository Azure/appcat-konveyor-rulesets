  message: |-
    The `HostServices::getWebContext` method, which was deprecated for removal in JDK 9, has been removed. There is no replacement for this functionality. 
    Applications will no longer be able to communicate with the enclosing web page of a JavaFX Applet. Note that the Java Plug-in, on which this functionality depends, is deprecated for removal as well.
