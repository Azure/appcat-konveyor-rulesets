  message: |-
    The `stop`, `destroy`, `isDestroyed`, `setDaemon` and `isDaemon` methods defined by `java.lang.ThreadGroup` have been terminally deprecated in this release.

    `ThreadGroup::stop` is inherently unsafe and has been deprecated since Java 1.2. The method is now terminally deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

    The API and mechanism for destroying a ThreadGroup is inherently flawed. The methods that support explicitly or automatically destroying a thread group have been terminally deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
