  message: |-
    The obsolete methods` traceInstructions(boolean)` and `traceMethodCalls(boolean)` have been removed from the `java.lang.Runtime` class. These methods have been non-functional for many releases, and their intended functions are provided by the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVMTI).
