```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: oracle-jdbc.jar
    path: ./libs/oracle-jdbc.jar
configuration:
  database:
    connectionString: "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydb"

metadata:
  applicationName: MyApp
  environment: development
properties:
  db.connectionURL: "jdbc:mysql://mysql-server:3306/dbname"
```

The `true` test case contains file patterns and content matching the rule conditions, while the `false` test case deliberately avoids such patterns to not trigger the rule. Both files are valid YAML configurations as requested.
